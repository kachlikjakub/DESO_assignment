# DESO applicants assignment

This application is made as a testing assignment for DESO.

App is coded in javascript, using React.js framework. No backend is implemented so all changes disappear when page gets refreshed.

E-shop products are dynamically loaded from external file `./src/constants/AvailableIProducts.jsx`

New navigation bar sections should be set by adding new object in states availableWindows in `./src/App.js`

No external libraries are used in this application.

## Quick set up

```bash
cd DESO_assignment
npm install
npm start
```
